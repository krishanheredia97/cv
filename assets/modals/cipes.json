      "description": "During my internship at the Centre for Research in Higher Education Policies (CIPES) in Aveiro, Portugal, I contributed to a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the Quality Assurance of the Third Mission of Higher Education Institutions Worldwide. Under the guidance of Dr. Maria Joao Rosa from the University of Aveiro, I gained valuable experience in the SLR research methodology, which I am now applying to my master's thesis. This internship provided me with hands-on experience in conducting rigorous academic research and honed my skills in literature analysis and synthesis."
