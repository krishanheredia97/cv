      "description": "Developed a highly accurate, real-time image recognition algorithm to identify tree canopies in the game RuneScape. This project served as an initial foray into image recognition, demonstrating proficiency in image manipulation and computer vision techniques. The algorithm successfully distinguishes tree canopies from other green elements in the game, highlighting them in real-time and providing clickable regions for interaction."
