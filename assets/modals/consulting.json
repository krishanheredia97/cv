      "title": "Academic and Professional Career Consultant for Latin American Students",
      "description": "As an independent consultant, I specialize in guiding Latin American students through their academic and professional journeys. My expertise lies in coaching students on finding, applying for, and securing scholarships, fellowships, and research stipends in higher education institutions, with a focus on graduate and doctoral level applications. By combining my theoretical and practical knowledge in storytelling and poetry with assertiveness training, I help students uncover and eloquently communicate their life stories and purposes in their applications. My innovative approach includes creating instructional content, fostering a collaborative learning community, and developing automated tools for personalized guidance. From August 2023 to January 2024, I worked with over 30 students, with notable successes including a student securing a position as a Spanish assistant in France and another gaining acceptance into two prestigious PhD programs at Trinity College Dublin and the University of Twente."
