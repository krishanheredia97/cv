      "description": "I earned my Bachelor of Arts Degree in Literature and Spanish Language from Universidad Industrial de Santander (2016-2021). During my studies, I had the opportunity to participate in an international exchange program at Université de Lille, France (2019). This combination of local and international education enriched my academic experience and broadened my cultural perspectives. My academic journey culminated in co-authoring a Bachelor's thesis that explored the intersection of gamification and student motivation in Spanish language education."
