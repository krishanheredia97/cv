      "description": "Qumahe is an ambitious transmedia project aimed at creating a 'School of Life' through narrative, gamification, and philosophy. The project's core message encourages critical thinking, holistic health, and personal motivation. Qumahe seeks to engage audiences across multiple platforms, including social media, YouTube, podcasts, and a dedicated website, to explore Qumahiki customs, language, myths, and legends. Future plans include book series, a fully gamified school curriculum, and a motivational mobile/web application. The project's ultimate goal is to foster collaborative learning and personal growth through an immersive, transmedia storytelling experience."
