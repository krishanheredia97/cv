This project showcases advanced web scraping techniques, data processing, and preparation for future applications. The scraped data serves as a foundation for other projects, including a flipping calculator for in-game investments. The scripts handle large-scale icon downloads with rate limiting and transform complex HTML content into structured markdown format, facilitating future AI training."
