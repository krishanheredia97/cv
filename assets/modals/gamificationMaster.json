      "description": "I completed a remote Master's program in Gamification and Transmedia Narrative at IEBS, Spain (2021-2022). This intensive one-year program, under the direction of gamification expert Dr. Oscar Garcia Pa√±ella, provided me with comprehensive knowledge in areas such as Motivational Design, Game Design, Storytelling, Playful Learning, and UX Design. I focused on merging storytelling and gamification to improve language learning, which I applied to my 'Academia Tutoros' project. The program also allowed me to develop 'Qumahe', a transmedia project. This master's degree has significantly enhanced my ability to apply gamification and transmedia storytelling principles to entrepreneurial and software development projects."
