      "description": "This innovative educational Role-Playing Game (RPG) seamlessly integrates learning and gaming to teach Machine Learning concepts. Set aboard the USS Odyssey, players embark on a cosmic journey, facing challenges that blend educational content with engaging gameplay. The game incorporates three main educational segments: vector navigation through an asteroid field, planetary cartography using vector norms, and a machine learning challenge to identify plants and cure a mysterious illness. Players progress from Ensigns to higher ranks by earning XP, Tera (in-game currency), and Honor points through various learning activities. The game features an upgradable AI companion and emphasizes collaborative learning through peer tutoring and project collaboration. This project serves as a minimum viable product (MVP) to demonstrate the core mechanics and educational potential of gamified learning in STEM fields."
