      "title": "Founder and CEO of Academia Tutoros",
      "description": "In response to the educational challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, I founded Academia Tutoros, a virtual language academy, in May 2020. Recognizing the urgent need for engaging online language education for pre-tertiary students, I built and led a team that quickly expanded to meet growing demand. This entrepreneurial venture not only provided valuable language learning opportunities to students aged 4-15 but also taught me crucial lessons in business management, marketing, and adaptability in a rapidly changing educational landscape. Through strategic growth and a focus on quality instruction, we successfully navigated the challenges of remote education and established a thriving virtual academy."
